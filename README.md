# Complete Machine Learning ðŸ“š
<br>
Welcome to my 100 Days of Machine Learning repository! This is a comprehensive collection of machine learning code implementations created during my 100-day journey. From foundational concepts to advanced techniques, this repository serves as a hands-on guide to mastering machine learning.
<br>
Repository Overview:
Daily Code Files: Each day is dedicated to a specific topic in machine learning, including detailed code implementations.
Focused on Machine Learning: All code files focus on core ML concepts like regression, classification, clustering, and more.
No Data Science Extras: The repository strictly contains ML-related code, without extraneous topics.
<br>
Key Topics Covered:
Supervised Learning: Regression, classification algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM).
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
Feature Engineering: Techniques such as feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and more.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and cross-validation techniques.
